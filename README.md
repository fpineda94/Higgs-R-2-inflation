# Higgs-R-2-inflation

A Python package for computing the inflationary background and the evolution of primordial perturbations in the multi-field Higgs–R² inflation model.

## Overview

This code provides a framework to analyze the multi-field dynamics of the Higgs–R² inflation model as a function of the number of e-folds or cosmic time.
It was used for the paper “Generating Isocurvature Modes and Primordial Features in Multi-field Higgs–R² Inflation.” The code automatically handles the following:

-Solve the background dynamics
-Compute adiabatic, isocurvature and tensorial perturbations
-Determine the primordial power spectrum

The code is written in Python with a modular, object-oriented design (OOP), making it easy to extend or adapt to other inflationary models.
