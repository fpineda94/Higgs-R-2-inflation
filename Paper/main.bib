abstract = {We discuss the inflationary dynamics of a system with a non-minimal coupling between the Higgs and the Ricci scalar as well as a Ricci scalar squared term. There are two scalar modes in this system, i.e. the Higgs and the spin-zero mode of the graviton, or the scalaron. We study the two-field dynamics of the Higgs and the scalaron during inflation, and clarify the condition where inflation is dominated by the Higgs/scalaron. We also find that the cut-off scale at around the vacuum is as large as the Planck scale, and hence there is no unitarity issue, although there is a constraint on the couplings from the perturbativity of the theory at around the vacuum.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {We study the dynamics of two-field models of inflation characterized by a hierarchy of masses between curvature and isocurvature modes.  When the hierarchy is large, a low energy effective field theory (EFT) exists in which only curvature modes participate in the dynamics of perturbations.  In this EFT heavy fields continue to have a significant role in the low energy dynamics, as their interaction with curvature modes reduces their speed of sound whenever the multi-field trajectory is subject to a sharp turn in target space.  Here we analyze under which general conditions this EFT remains a reliable description for the linear evolution of curvature modes.  We find that the main condition consists on demanding that the rate of change of the turn's angular velocity stays suppressed with respect to the masses of heavy modes.  This adiabaticity condition allows the EFT to accurately describe a large variety of situations in which the multi-field trajectory is subject to sharp turns.  To test this, we analyze several models with turns and show that, indeed, the power spectra obtained for both the original two-field theory and its single-field EFT are identical when the adiabaticity condition is satisfied.  In particular, when turns are sharp and sudden, they are found to generate large features in the power spectrum, accurately reproduced by the EFT.}

abstract = {We introduce a frame-covariant formalism for inflation of scalar-curvature theories by adopting a differential geometric approach which treats the scalar fields as coordinates living on a field-space manifold. This ensures that our description of inflation is both conformally and reparameterization covariant. Our formulation gives rise to extensions of the usual Hubble and potential slow-roll parameters to generalized fully frame-covariant forms, which allow us to provide manifestly frame-invariant predictions for cosmological observables, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, the spectral indices nR and nT, their runnings αR and αT, the non-Gaussianity parameter fNL, and the isocurvature fraction βiso. We examine the role of the field space curvature in the generation and transfer of isocurvature modes, and we investigate the effect of boundary conditions for the scalar fields at the end of inflation on the observable inflationary quantities. We explore the stability of the trajectories with respect to the boundary conditions by using a suitable sensitivity parameter. To illustrate our approach, we first analyze a simple minimal two-field scenario before studying a more realistic nonminimal model inspired by Higgs inflation. We find that isocurvature effects are greatly enhanced in the latter scenario and must be taken into account for certain values in the parameter space such that the model is properly normalized to the observed scalar power spectrum PR. Finally, we outline how our frame-covariant approach may be extended beyond the tree-level approximation through the Vilkovisky–De Witt formalism, which we generalize to take into account conformal transformations, thereby leading to a fully frame-invariant effective action at the one-loop level.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {The computation of the primordial power spectrum in multi-field inflation models requires us to correctly account for all relevant interactions between adiabatic and non-adiabatic modes around and after horizon crossing. One specific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the curvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In this work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show that certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant imprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton trajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without interrupting slow roll), even in cases where the modes normal to the trajectory have masses approaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasize that turning is defined with respect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether this is canonical or non-trivial.  The imprints generically take the form of damped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case of two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to the scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory for the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full multi-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this effective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a functional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during inflation. Hence in addition, we expect non-Gaussian signatures directly related to the features imprinted in the power spectrum.}

For the quartic Higgs self-coupling λ fixed at the electroweak scale, we find that the resulting inflationary two-field model effectively reduces to a single field model with the same predictions as in Higgs inflation or Starobinsky inflation, including the limit of a vanishing non-minimal coupling. For the same model, but with the scalar field a priori not identified with the Standard Model Higgs boson, we study the inflationary consequences of an extremely small λ. Depending on the initial conditions for the inflationary background trajectories, we find that the two-field dynamics either again reduces to an effective single-field model with a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio than predicted in Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation, or involves the full two-field dynamics and leads to oscillatory features in the inflationary power spectrum. Finally, we investigate under which conditions the inflationary scenario with extremely small λ can be realized dynamically by the Standard Model renormalization group flow and discuss how the scalaron-Higgs model can provide a natural way to stabilize the electroweak vacuum.}

In the slow-roll approximation, explicit closed-form long-wave solutions for field and metric perturbations are obtained by the analysis in the Einstein frame. Since the evolution of fluctuations depends on specific gravity theories, we make detailed investigations based on analytic and numerical approaches in four generalized Einstein theories: the Jordan–Brans–Dicke (JBD) theory, the Einstein gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field, the higher-dimensional Kaluza–Klein theory, and the R+R2 theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field. We find that solutions obtained in the slow-roll approximation show good agreement with full numerical results except around the end of inflation. Due to the presence of isocurvature perturbations, the gravitational potential Φ and the curvature perturbation ζ do not remain constant on super-horizon scales. In particular, we find that negative non-minimal coupling can lead to strong enhancement of ζ in both the Einstein and higher derivative gravity, in which case it is difficult to unambiguously decompose scalar perturbations into adiabatic and isocurvature modes during the whole stage of inflation.}

To the next-to-leading order in slow roll parameters we calculate amplitudes and indices of scalar and tensor perturbations produced at inflation. The results are compared to the next-to-leading order predictions of R2-inflation with minimally coupled Higgs field and of Higgs-inflation. We discuss additional features in gravity wave signal that may help to distinguish the proposed variant of R2-inflation.

abstract = {We investigate whether Higgs inflation can occur in the Standard Model starting from natural initial conditions or not. The Higgs has a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar. We confine our attention to the regime where quantum Einstein gravity effects are small in order to have results that are independent of the ultraviolet completion of gravity. At the classical level we find no tuning is required to have successful Higgs inflation, provided the initial homogeneity condition is satisfied. On the other hand, at the quantum level we obtain that the renormalization for large non-minimal coupling requires an additional degree of freedom, unless a tuning of the initial values of the running parameters is made. In order to see that this effect may change the predictions we finally include such degree of freedom in the field content and show that Starobinsky's R2 inflation dominates over Higgs inflation.}

abstract = {We present in a manifestly gauge-invariant form the theory of classical linear gravitational perturbations in part I, and a quantum theory of cosmological perturbations in part II. Part I includes applications to several important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe models is presented. The gauge-invariant theory of cosmological perturbations also allows a consistent and gauge-invariant definition of statistical fluctuations.}

Our analysis includes k-inflation, Dirac–Born–Infeld inflation and its multi-field extensions which have been recently studied. For this general class of models, we calculate the action to second order in the linear perturbations. We decompose the perturbations into an adiabatic mode, parallel to the background trajectory, and entropy modes. We show that all the entropy modes propagate with the speed of light whereas the adiabatic mode propagates with an effective speed of sound. We also identify the specific combination of entropy modes which sources the curvature perturbation on large scales. We then study in some detail the case of two scalar fields: we write explicitly the equations of motion for the adiabatic and entropy modes in a compact form and discuss their quantum fluctuations and primordial power spectra.}

	abstract = {It has recently been suggested that at the post-inationary stage of the mixed Higgs-R2 model of ination efficient particle production can arise from the tachyonic instability of the Higgs field. It might complete the preheating of the Universe if appropriate conditions are satisfied, especially in the Higgs-like regime. In this paper, we study this behavior in more depth, including the conditions for occurrence, analytical estimates for the maximal efficiency, and the necessary degree of fine-tuning among the model parameters to complete preheating by this effect. We find that the parameter sets that cause the most efficient tachyonic instabilities obey simple laws in both the Higgs-like regime and the R2-like regime, respectively. We then estimate the efficiency of this instability. In particular, even in the deep R2-like regime with a small non-minimal coupling, this effect is strong enough to complete preheating although a severe fine-tuning is required among the model parameters. We also estimate how much fine-tuning is needed to complete preheating by this effect. It is shown that the fine-tuning of parameters for the sufficient particle production is at least < O(0:1) in the deep Higgs-like regime with a large scalaron mass, while it is more severe ∼ O(10-4){O(10-5) in the R2-like regime with a small non-minimal coupling.}},

In this letter, we study the inflaton oscillation stage after inflation, focusing on the effective mass of the phase direction of the Higgs field, which can cause a violent preheating process. We find that the ``spikes'' in the effective mass of the phase direction observed in the Higgs inflation still appear in the mixed Higgs-R 2 model. While the spikes appear above the cut-off scale in the Higgs-only case, they appear below the cut-off scale when the model is extended with R 2 term though reheating cannot be completed in the violent particle production regime since the spikes get milder.},

In this paper, we discuss the effect of perturbative decay during (p)reheating in this model. It is shown that perturbative decay can play an important role throughout the whole reheating process. Depending on the model parameters, perturbative decay can affect different stages of the reheating. We study the perturbative reheating with and without the presence of early preheating stage, and calculate the reheating temperature and the duration of the whole perturbative process. We find that the detail of the early preheating stage may not affect the final reheating temperature while it can affect the number of e-folds of reheating.},

	abstract = {Strong coupling in Higgs inflation at high energies hinders a joint description of inflation, reheating and low-energy dynamics. The situation may be improved with a proper UV completion of the model. A well-defined self-consistent way is to introduce an R2-term into the action. In this modified model the strong coupling scale returns back to the Planck scale, which justifies the use of the perturbative methods in studies of the model dynamics after inflation. We investigate the reheating of the post-inflationary Universe, which involves two highly anharmonic oscillators strongly interacting with each other: homogeneous Higgs field and scalaron. We observe that in interesting regions of model parameter space these oscillations make longitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons tachyonic, triggering instant preheating at timescales much shorter than the Hubble time. The weak gauge bosons are heavy and decay promptly into light Standard Model particles, ensuring the onset of the radiation domination era right after inflation.},

	abstract = {Gravitational particle production in cosmology is a mechanism through which particles of different natures are produced during the very early universe. It is a general mechanism that explains how the universe became populated with the particles of the Standard Model after cosmic inflation and may also account for the origin of dark matter. In this work, we study the non-perturbative production of massive scalar particles in the Higgs-{\$}{\$}R\^{}2{\$}{\$}inflation model, a two-field scalar inflation model within the Einstein frame. We consider spectator scalar fields that are conformally or minimally coupled to the gravitational field through the curvature scalar R which in turn is a time-dependent function determined by the fields driving inflationary dynamics. We numerically compute the production of these particles using the Bogolyubov transformation method for each scenario, aiming to assess the spectrum of the produced particles. For both scenarios, we consider light particles with masses {\$}{\$}m{\_}{$\backslash$}chi {$\backslash$}ll H{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}end{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and large masses that exceed the Hubble scale at the end of inflation {\$}{\$}m{\_}{$\backslash$}chi {$\backslash$}gtrsim H{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}textrm{\{}end{\}}{\}}.{\$}{\$}We use these numerical results to calculate the relic abundance {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}Omega {\_}{$\backslash$}chi h\^{}2{\$}{\$}to find out if the model is viable as a dark matter candidate.},

	abstract = {We study the cosmological collider signatures in the Higgs-R 2 inflation model. We consider two distinct types of signals: one originating from the inflaton coupling to Standard Model fermions and gauge bosons, and another arising from the isocurvature mode interaction with the inflaton. In the former case, we determine that the signal magnitude is likely too small for detection by upcoming probes, primarily due to suppression by both the Planck scale and slow-roll parameters. However, we provide a detailed computation of the signal which could be potentially applicable to various Higgs inflation variants. For the isocurvature mode signals, we observe that the associated couplings remain unsuppressed when the isocurvature mode is relatively light or comparable to the inflationary scale. In this case, we study the Higgs-R 2 inflation parameter space that corresponds to the quasi-single-field inflation regime and find that the signal strength could be as large as |f NL| &gt; 1, making Higgs-R 2 inflation a viable candidate for observation by future 21-cm surveys.},

We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from the Planck mission. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1.  To test the dependence of our results on non-ACT data, we also explore combinations replacing Planck with WMAP and DESI with BOSS, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history.  We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index dns /d ln k = 0.0062 $\pm$ 0.0052) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming (N eff = 2.86 $\pm$ 0.13, which combined with astrophysical measurements of primordial helium and deuterium abundances becomes N eff = 2.89 $\pm$ 0.11), for non-zero neutrino masses (∑mν  &lt; 0.089 eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation (N idr &lt; 0.134), or for early-universe variation of fundamental constants, including the fine-structure constant (α EM/α EM,0 = 1.0043 $\pm$ 0.0017) and the electron mass (me /me,0  = 1.0063 $\pm$ 0.0056).  Our data are consistent with standard big bang nucleosynthesis (we find Yp  = 0.2312 $\pm$ 0.0092), the COBE/FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature (we find T CMB = 2.698 $\pm$ 0.016 K), a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant (w = -0.986 $\pm$ 0.025), and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity (γ = 0.663 $\pm$ 0.052).  We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline ΛCDM model.  In fits to models invoking early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or an arbitrary modified recombination history, we find H 0 = 69.9+0.8 -1.5, 69.1 $\pm$ 0.5, or 69.6 $\pm$ 1.0 km/s/Mpc, respectively; using BOSS instead of DESI BAO data reduces the central values of these constraints by 1--1.5 km/s/Mpc while only slightly increasing the error bars.  In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored over ΛCDM by our data.},
